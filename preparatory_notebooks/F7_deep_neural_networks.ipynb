Composition of a Neural Network\nA cornerstone of the neural network model is linear regression. We can write the linear regression model in the following form:\n\n$$f(\\mathbf{x}; \\mathbf{\\theta}) = \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b} ,$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{x} = [x_1,..., x_d]^\\intercal$ and $\\mathbf{\\theta} = [\\mathbf{W}, \\,\\mathbf{b}]^\\intercal$.\n\nThe neural network for regression is built on this model, but with a twist! More specifically, a neural network contains multiple linear regressions with nonlinear activation functions $h(\\cdot)$, which can be written as\n$$f(\\mathbf{x}; \\mathbf{\\theta}) = \\mathbf{W}^{(2)\\intercal} \\mathbf{q(\\mathbf{x})} + \\mathbf{b}^{(2)}$$\n\n$$ \\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{x}) = h(\\mathbf{W}^{(1)}\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}^{(1)})\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{x})$ is an intermediate variable.

One commonly used activation function in neural networks is the **Re**ctified **L**inear **U**nit (ReLU), which is defined as follows:\n$$\\mathrm{ReLU}(x) = \\mathrm{max}(x, 0).$$\n\nThe activation function is used to insert non-linearity into the network. Without a non-linear activation function, the model can be reduced to a simple linear regression, which renders the additional step of transforming the input variables with $\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{x})$ obsolete.\n\nIn addition, we can also use the **Sigmoid** and **Tanh** as activation functions that are defined by\n$$ \\mathrm{Sigmoid}(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}, \\quad \\mathrm{Tanh}(x) = \\frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x}+e^{-x}}. $$\n\n\nBelow is an example of fitting non-linear data with a two-layer neural network."}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "id": "kdiMlNJt-vzn", "metadata": {"colab": {"base_uri": "https://localhost:8080/", "height": 472}, "id": "kdiMlNJt-vzn", "outputId": "6583fe78-788b-40fe-e174-14b8ba2e7360", "tags": []}, "outputs": [], "source": ""}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "895defe0", "metadata": {"tags": []}, "source": "**Task:** \n\n- Can you change the parameter to other values and fit the same dataset again?"}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "id": "3d40a4bc", "metadata": {"tags": []}, "outputs": [], "source": ""}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "zlY8BlYl-5Kb", "metadata": {"id": "zlY8BlYl-5Kb", "tags": []}, "source": "### 1.2 Neural Network with multiple hidden layers\nTo get a more complex neural network multiple transformations $\\mathbf{q}$ of the input data can be added in series, so that the result of one transformation is the input to the next transformation.

With it you are able to design a simple neural network and train it directly in your browser.\n\nThe training of a neural network is performed with a method called stochastic gradient descent, which you will learn more about in the next lecture. The weights and biases in the network are initialized with random weights and then will be updated iteratively in order to minimize a certain loss function. The training only finds a local minimum of the loss function so different parameter initializations can give different results.\n\nIn the following tasks you will design and train a neural network for a simple classification problem.\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. Open the link above (settings will be pre-selected).\n\n2. Remove both the hidden layers and click the play button to train your network.\n\n3. Select $X_1^2$ and $X_2^2$ as the current input features to train your model. As you can see this gives a very good fit to the provided data (for most of the parameter initializations). Why is that?\n\n4. Go back to using $X_1$ and $X_2$ as input features and add a hidden layer with 6 neurons. Train your model.\n\n5. Try different numbers of neurons in the hidden layer. What is the minimum number of neurons that the model needs to obtain a good fit to this data?\n\n"}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "id": "427e61a2", "metadata": {"tags": []}, "outputs": [], "source": ""}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "56793550", "metadata": {"tags": []}, "source": "---\n## 3.
